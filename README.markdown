# fresh
this little bash script, originally written for my machine specifically and ubuntu, takes a default, basic installed image of ubuntu (anything post 8.10 has been tested) and installs and configures all the programs and features that I wanted to have.

any contributions are welcome. 

current roadmap:
## 1) add option for zenity-based install
## 2) break down the main install function into smaller chunks
